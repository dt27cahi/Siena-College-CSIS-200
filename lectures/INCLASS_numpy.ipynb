    "## General probability rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability (or odds) of something occurring is the number of ways that *it* can happen, divided by *all* the possible ways that everything all together can happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the probability of flipping a quarter and getting heads is the number of ways you can get heads (1) divided by the number of ways everything can happen (heads or tails = 1 + 1 = 2)\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{heads}) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## And\n",
    "\n",
    "If know the probability of A happening is $P_A$ and you know the probability of B happening is $P_B$, then the probability of A *and* B happening is the product of the two individual probabilities. \n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{A or B}) = P_A \\times P_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, flipping a coin and getting heads on one flip *and* heads on the next flip would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{heads and then heads}) = P_{\\textrm{heads}} \\times P_{\\textrm{heads}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Or\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the the probability of A *or* B happening is the sum of the two individual probabilities. \n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{A or B}) = P_A + P_B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, flipping a coin and getting heads *or* tails would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{heads or tails}) = P_{\\textrm{heads}} + P_{\\textrm{tails}} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability of the converse\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of *everything that can happen* added together is 1, by definition. This means that sometimes it is easier to calculate the converse (the opposite) of what you want and then subtract it from 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = 1 - P(\\textrm{Everything that is not A})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the probability of rolling a 1,2,3,4, or 5 on a 6-sided die is just 1 minus the probability of rolling a 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\textrm{1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5}) = 1 - P(6) = 1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Same birthday odds\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have 25 people in the room. What are the odds that **at least** two of them, have the same birthday. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way to solve the problem is to calculate the odds that *none of them* have the same birthday, and then subtract that from 1 to get every other possibility (2 have the same birthday, 2 sets of 2 have the same birthday, 3 have the same birthday, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the probability that no one has the same birthday, calculate chances for each person, starting with the first. \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(0)=1$: Person 0 has a birthday *sometime*. \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(1)=364/365$: Person 1 has a birthday that is not the same as Person 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(2)=363/365$: Person 2 has a birthday that is not the same as Person 0 *or* Person 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on....\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{Probability that no one has the same birthday} = \\left(1\\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times ... \\frac{340}{365}\\right)$$\n",
