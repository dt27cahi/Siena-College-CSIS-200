# Opening IDLE

Once the Anaconda Python distribution is installed, you should have access to the editor, IDLE. To open IDLE...

## Mac
* Open a Terminal. You can do this by going to Searchlight and starting to type "terminal".
* Once the terminal opens, then type

    idle3

Or...

* Click on the Spotlight icon (the magnifying glass) in the upper right of your screen. 
* Start typing "idle" in the search window. 
* Double-click on the appropriate icon. 

## Windows

* Launch "Anaconda Prompt"
* At the prompt (flashing cursor) type "idle"

Or..... (these might not work)

* Press the "Windows key" and "r" at the same time (or search computer for "run")
* In the "Run" window type: "cmd" (no quotes)
* When Command Prompt comes up, type: "start idle"

Or...

* Click on the Windows Start button (lower left on many computers)
* In the "Search" window bar (at the bottom) start typing "idle"
* Click on the appropriate search result, either "IDLE" or "IDLE (Python GUI)"


# Using IDLE 

When IDLE is first opened, you have access to the [Python interpreter](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/interpreter.html).
That is, everything you type is exectuted a Python in an interactive environment. 
```
>>> x = 10
>>> print x
10
```

To open a file (Python script) do

**File --> Open**

To save a file do

**File --> Save** or just *Ctrl-s*

To run/execute the script do

**Run --> Run Module** or just *F5* (or *fn-F5* on Mac)

For most of this class we will be using IDLE as a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor): we will use it to actuall write and edit our code. 

IDLE, like most text editors, has a nice syntax highlighting feature that recognizes that we are writing Python and so highlights and formats words and phrases to draw a distinction between different parts of your code. 

IDLE is *not* a programming language and is not the same as Python. IDLE is similar to a word processor in that you can use it write whatever you want in any language if you wanted.
