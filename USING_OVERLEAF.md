## Starting a new project/document from scratch

* Click on the green `NEW PROJECT` button in the upper left. 
* Usually what you want to do next is select the `Blank Paper` template from the **Basics** options. 
* Rename the project to be something descriptive, so that you can find it later. 
** Directions on how to do this can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/help/26-how-do-i-rename-a-project-in-my-projects#.Wfgb7rxKuCg).

## Uploading your own LaTeX files from your laptop

This should be easier than it is, but we can make it work. 

* First, start a new project, following the instructions above. 
* Make sure you are in the project view, as if you were editing the `main.tex` file. 
* In the very upper left, there is a drop-down menu, `Files...`. Click on this and select `Upload from...Computer`
* Upload whatever files you want. Probably there will be some sort of `.tex` file, but there will also might be images or `.bib` files. Make sure you upload all the files you need for your project. 
* If you have uploaded a `.tex` file that has your primary LaTeX code in, it you need to set it as the main document.
** In the left column that shows the different files, find your primary `.tex` file. 
** Mouse over it to get the arrow to appear on the right. Click on this to get the drop down menu and click on `Set as Main File`
* Once you've done this, you can delete the original `main.tex` file that Overleaf created. 
** In the left column that shows the different files, find the old `main.tex` file. 
** Mouse over it to get the arrow to appear on the right. Click on this to get the drop down menu and click on `Delete`
