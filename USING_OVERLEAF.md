## Starting a new project/document from scratch

* Click on the green `NEW PROJECT` button in the upper left. 
* Usually what you want to do next is select the `Blank Paper` template from the **Basics** options. 
* Rename the project to be something descriptive, so that you can find it later. 
** Directions on how to do this can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/help/26-how-do-i-rename-a-project-in-my-projects#.Wfgb7rxKuCg).
