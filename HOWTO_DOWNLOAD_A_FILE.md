There have been inconsistencies in downloading Python files from a website on different people's computers. Here's
how we can do things properly. 

1 Use the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/). I think much of the problems
came from using Safari (on Macs) or IE (on Windows). Even if you don't use it for everything, you should use
Chrome for this class for downloading files. If you don't already have it, click [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/).

2 If the file is on Github, then
  1. Go to the file.
  1. Click on **Raw** in the upper right.
  1. Click **Ctrl-s** or **Command-s** on Macs to save.

3 You want to verify with your File Manager (Finder on Mac, My Computer or File Explorer on Windows) that the file you downloaded has either the **.py** or **.ipynb** at the very end, depending on the type of file you download. 

On Windows, you can do this in File Manager by doing XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Good luck!
