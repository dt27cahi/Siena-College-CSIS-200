For your final project, you will have to upload everything to Github. Here's instructions on how you will do that. 

Remember, uploading it to Github is *part* of the final project, so you need to be able to follow these directions to do that, without my help. 

1. Create a repository on Github called

     **CSIS200_Final_Project_F16**
    
      a. Make sure it is *Public*.
      
      b. Give it a README. 

2. Clone this repository to your laptop. You will now have a directory called **CSIS200_Final_Project_F16** on your laptop. 

3. Copy all your final project files to this directory. You should have in there...
    a. Your Jupyter Notebook. 
    b. Your LaTeX .tex file of your writeup. 
    c. The .pdf file of your writeup generated by your LaTeX file.
    d. Any images/plots/figures that appear in your writeup. 

4. Add these files to the repository using the following command. (make sure you're in the directory)

 ```
 git add FILENAME1 FILENAME2 FILENAME3...
 ```

5. When you have the final versions there, commit them to the repository with 
 an appropriate message and using *-a* for all files. 
 
 ```
 git commit -m "A COMMIT MESSAGE OF YOUR CHOICE" -a
 ```
 
6. Push everything up to the Github repository. 
 
 ```
 git push
 ```
 
7. Check on Github to make sure all your files are there!
