# Set up things on your laptop

* Go to the [Github help guide](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
* Open up a Git Bash window (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) in which to type git commands. 
* Follow the instructions on the website to make sure your version of git is all configured to work with Github.
   * If you come across anything on the Github site that mentions installing the **Github Desktop**, you do not need to do this. 
* The key points are to make sure your local Git repo knows about you. For the following commands, use the user name and email you used when you registered with Github. 

         git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
         git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"

* When you get to the section that says **Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git** choose **Connecting over HTTPS (recommended)"** and go to the *cache your GitHub password in Git* link.
