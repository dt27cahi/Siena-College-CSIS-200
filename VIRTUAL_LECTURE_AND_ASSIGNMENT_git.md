This lecture and assignment will introduce you to the ideas of version control, git, and Github. 
In a nutshell, here is a brief explanation. 

* **Version control** is a *concept* in software development. The idea is that if you and others (or sometimes just you) are working on a project, you need a way to keep track of changes to the code so that you can keep track of what everyone is doing and undo changes, if necessary. 
* **git** is one of a number of *programs* that allow you to handle version control on your software. 
* **Github** is a website that uses git to allow people to host their software on their site. It's free if you don't mind if the whole world sees your code, though you can pay for privacy. 

Here's what you should do today. While it might seem confusing at first, my hope is that by the end of it, you'll have a rough idea of what version control, git, and Github are all about.
