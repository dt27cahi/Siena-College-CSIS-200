Helper links to install the programs used in this course.

-------

# Python
* You should use the [Anaconda installer from Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/downloads). It is free and their website has plenty of information to help you install it properly on your laptop. 
* WHEN GO TO INSTALL THE PROGRAM, YOU SHOULD INSTALL Python 2.7, ***NOT*** Python 3.5.

It may take up to an hour to download, depending on the wireless network. Once you download it, it will either start installing itself, or you can double-click on the downloaded file and follow the instructions. 

More installation information can be found here:

# LaTeX
## Windows
* [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/) distribution. [Download here.](http://miktex.org/download)
* If you have installed it properly, you can now open up [TeXWorks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/) on your computer. This will be your primary editing environment.

## Mac
* [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/) distribution. [Download here.](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html)
* If you have installed it properly, you can now open up [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/texshop.html) on your computer. This will be your primary editing environment. You may have to Search (Spotlight) on your computer to find TeXShop, if it is not in the Launch bar. 

## Online (cloud) options

If you don't want to install LaTeX on your laptop, there are some online options as well. It just means you need an internet connection to get work done. However, it can save you time with the setup and still allow you to download the finished file (PDF). 

* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
* [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/)
* [Sage Math Cloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/)

These are all free. If you want to use one of them, create an account and learn how to upload a file or create one from scratch, and then turn it into a PDF file.

# Sage Math Cloud
* Sign up for an account [here](https://cloud.sagemath.com/).
* From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SageMathCloud): "*SageMathCloud is a cloud computing platform designed for computational mathematics. Part of the Sage project, it supports editing of Sage worksheets, LaTeX documents, and IPython notebooks. SageMathCloud runs an Ubuntu Linux environment that can be interacted with through a terminal, additionally giving access to most of the capabilities of Linux.[1] It can be freely accessed online and requires an account to use.*"

# Git
* Instructions to install Git on both Windows and Mac can be found on [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) (links on right). 
   * You should *not* install the "Graphical Clients" at this time. Just use the "Install Git" links. 

## Windows
* When you download the file and double click the file to install, you will have different options. Just take the defaults except...
   * Select "Additional Icons for Desktop" and "Quick Launch"
   * You will also only be installing "Git Bash" (one of the defaults). This means you will use Git in Linux-like environment. 
* When you have installed everything, launch "Git Bash". You should get a window that looks like the Linux stuff we were doing.
* This environment works just like Linux, so you can use all your commands here. To make sure things work, type

         git --version

* If it works you will see something like

         git version 2.6.3.windows.1

## Mac
* Download the file and double click the file to install, if it doesn't automatically. 
* When you have installed everything, open a **Terminal** and type

         git --version

* If it works you will see something like

         git version 2.6.2
