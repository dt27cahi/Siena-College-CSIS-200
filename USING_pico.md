These instructions work equally well if you are using the `nano` program to edit files. Just replace
`pico` with `nano` below and everything here will work the same. 

To open a file named FILENAME with pico.

        pico FILENAME

To save the file without exiting, use the Ctrl key and the "o" key. 

        Ctrl-o

It will prompt you for the filename to save it to. If you want to save it to the same name (the usual),
just hit **Enter**. Otherwise, enter in a new filename and hit **Enter**.

To save the file and exit, use the Ctrl key and the "x" key. 

        Ctrl-x

It will prompt you for the filename to save it to. If you want to save it to the same name (the usual),
just hit **Enter**. Otherwise, enter in a new filename and hit **Enter**.

There are a bunch of other commands at the bottom of the screen, most involving the Ctrl key. You can explore
these at your leisure.
